# Relational Data Model - ER Diagram (Text-Based)

This diagram outlines the database schema for the property management application.

## Tables

### Agents
The central entity representing property agents.

- **Table**: `agents`
- **Columns**:
  - `id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the agent.
  - `firstName` (String): Agent's first name.
  - `lastName` (String): Agent's last name.
  - `email` (String, Unique): Agent's email address.
  - `mobileNumber` (String): Agent's mobile phone number.
  - `createdAt` (Timestamp): Timestamp of when the record was created.
  - `updatedAt` (Timestamp): Timestamp of when the record was last updated.

### Properties
Represents the rental properties managed by an agent.

- **Table**: `properties`
- **Columns**:
  - `id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the property.
  - `agent_id` (UUID, Foreign Key -> agents.id): The agent managing this property.
  - `address` (String): The physical address of the property.
  - `description` (Text): A description of the property.
  - `createdAt` (Timestamp): Timestamp of when the record was created.
  - `updatedAt` (Timestamp): Timestamp of when the record was last updated.

### Tenants
Represents tenants or families occupying a rental property.

- **Table**: `tenants`
- **Columns**:
  - `id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the tenant.
  - `property_id` (UUID, Foreign Key -> properties.id): The property the tenant is renting.
  - `name` (String): The name of the tenant or head of the family.
  - `contact_email` (String): Contact email for the tenant.
  - `contact_phone` (String): Contact phone number for the tenant.
  - `lease_start` (Date): The start date of the lease agreement.
  - `lease_end` (Date): The end date of the lease agreement.
  - `createdAt` (Timestamp): Timestamp of when the record was created.
  - `updatedAt` (Timestamp): Timestamp of when the record was last updated.

### Notes
For notes or reminders, typically for property maintenance.

- **Table**: `notes`
- **Columns**:
  - `id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the note.
  - `property_id` (UUID, Foreign Key -> properties.id): The property the note is associated with.
  - `title` (String): A short title for the note.
  - `content` (Text): The full content of the note or reminder.
  - `is_reminder` (Boolean): Flag to indicate if this note is a reminder.
  - `reminder_date` (Timestamp, Nullable): The date for the reminder if applicable.
  - `createdAt` (Timestamp): Timestamp of when the record was created.

## Relationships

- **One-to-Many**: An `Agent` can manage multiple `Properties`.
  - `agents.id` (1) --- (*) `properties.agent_id`

- **One-to-Many**: A `Property` can have multiple `Tenants`.
  - `properties.id` (1) --- (*) `tenants.property_id`

- **One-to-Many**: A `Property` can have multiple `Notes`.
  - `properties.id` (1) --- (*) `notes.property_id`

## Constraints

- **Primary Keys**: `id` column in each table.
- **Foreign Keys**: `agent_id`, `property_id` establish relationships.
- **Uniqueness**: `agents.email` must be unique.
- **Not Null**: Primary keys, foreign keys, and core fields (e.g., `agents.firstName`, `properties.address`) should not be null.
